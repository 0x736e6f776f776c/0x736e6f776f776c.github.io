## Introduction
Welcome to my website! I like programming, and have a passion for cyber security. I'm a reverse engineer, and I work on an indie game when I have some extra time. Besides tech I like playing chess, reading books, and playing the piano. On this website I'll post technical blogs, guides, and more related to all sorts of tech. Take a look around and see if you find anything interesting.
