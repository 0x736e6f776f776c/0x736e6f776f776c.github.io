## Introduction
Welcome to my website! I'm a programmer, reverse engineer, indie game dev, and cyber security researcher. Besides tech also enjoy playing the piano, chess, and reading books. On this website I post technical blogs, guides, and more related to all sorts of tech. Take a look around and see if you find anything interesting.
