**This is a draft for a guide on how to install stock firmware on a Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+**

## Preperations
This is a list of all the things you'll have to prepare in order to install stock firmware on you S9(+), make sure to follow all of these steps:
* First, go to *Settings*, then go to *About phone*, and note down your model number. You should see something like this:

* Afterwards, go to [SamMobile](https://www.sammobile.com/). Click on the join button and sign up. You can choose whatever membership you want, the free one is sufficient for what we need. After signing up, verify your email address, then go to https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares/recent/. Enter your device's model number and your country code. You should see a list of firmware versions for your device. For example, this is what it looks like for my device:

  Click on the version you want to install on your device. Check if the country box contains the correct information; it should display the country in which you bought your phone and the provider from whom you bought it. After making sure that's correct, click *wait and download* if you chose the free membership or *fast download* if you chose a premium membership. Wait for 30 seconds and hit *Download*. Choose to save the zip file, and let it download. 
  When the download is done, unzip the .zip file (using a program like [WinZip](https://www.winzip.com/win/nl/) or [7-Zip (my personal favorite)](https://www.7-zip.org/)). You should have five files in the decompressed folder, looking something like this:

* In order to install stock firmware on your S9(+) with Odin, you'll be needing the [Samsung USB Drivers for Windows](https://developer.samsung.com/mobile/android-usb-driver.html). On the page, click on *SAMSUNG_USB_Driver_for_Mobile_Phones.exe(vx.x)*. Download the executable, run it, and follow the steps in the installation wizard.
* Next up, go to https://www.odinflash.com/. Download the latest version of Odin. This is the software we're going to use to flash the stock firmware onto your device. Unzip the files. You should have the following four files in the unzipped folder:

  The Odin software is portable, so there's no need to install anything.
